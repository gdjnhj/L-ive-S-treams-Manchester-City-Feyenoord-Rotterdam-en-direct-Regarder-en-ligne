The hosts are rock bottom in the group standings, having lost all of their first four games. Manchester City are 20th in the standings, with two wins from their four matches. Having been held in their last two league games, Milan will be looking to return to winning ways with this fixture.

Manchester City returns to Champions League action, aiming to build on their recent momentum after a season marked by inconsistency. Following a stellar 3-1 victory over Real Madrid on the last matchday, Milan showcased one of their best performances of the campaign, solidifying their position in the standings and reigniting their push for advancement.
